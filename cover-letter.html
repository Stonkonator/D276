<p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
                
<p>With over 11 years of experience building custom software and integrations, managing enterprise software environments, and developing data-driven solutions, I am passionate about leveraging technology to achieve tangible growth, and I would love the opportunity to provide that for your organization.</p>
                
<p>Throughout my career, I have consistently demonstrated my technical abilities through creating scalable solutions that improve operational efficiency and drive measurable business results. In my current role as the Vice President of Technology at Core Value Insurance Group, I have built a scalable custom CRM-telephony integration that saved over 81,000 minutes and increased company-wide sales by 10% in under 2 months. Additionally, I created a data infrastructure and reporting system that replaced a $100K+ vendor solution, delivering significant cost savings while also improving data accessibility. The insights generated by this system enabled an additional 8% lift in sales, increased operational efficiency, and provided leadership with invaluable, actionable insights into company performance.</p>
                
<p>My technical skills in software development, process automation, and data management have enabled me to develop and lead many impactful projects, including:</p>
                
<ul>
<li><strong>Call Center Automation Software:</strong> Developed comprehensive process automation software and custom integrations which lowered manual workloads by 400+ hours, increased sales efficiency, reduced overall talk time, and shortened new-hire onboarding by 1 week.</li>
<li><strong>Medical Record Sales AI System:</strong> Spearheaded the creation of an AI-integrated sales system that processed a consumer's medical records to match them with a health plan based on their current and predicted health needs, which boosted customer acquisition by 32% via ML-based data processing for diagnostic predictions and automating health plan selection.</li>
<li><strong>Conversational AI Customer Screening Agent:</strong> Created a conversational AI screener phone agent with RAG, which increased sales by 12% company-wide by delivering prequalified client calls to sales agents and diverting calls to the proper department.</li>
</ul>
                
<p>What really sets me apart is my passion and my ability to sync technical implementation and business strategy by providing explainable solutions and tangible outcomes. Technology isn't just about writing code or automating processes; it's about solving real-world problems and creating value. My experience in project management and cross-functional communication also allows me to work effectively with stakeholders and manage diverse teams to deliver solutions that align with organizational goals.</p>
                
<p>Currently, I am pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Western Governors University, where I am continuing to grow my technical knowledge and master emerging technologies. My expertise in programming, along with my practical experience in system administration and API management, enables me to overcome diverse and complex technical/operational challenges.</p>
                
<p>I am excited about the opportunity to bring my technical expertise and business acumen to our organization. I am confident that my proven track record of delivering innovative technical solutions and driving measurable results shows that I am a valuable addition to the team.</p>
                
<p>Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss in more detail how my skills and experience exceed your needs.</p>
                
<p>All the best,<br>
Cody Nason<br>
